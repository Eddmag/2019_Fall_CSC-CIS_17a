/* 
 * File:   main.cpp
 * Author: Edgar Magaña
 * Created on November 20, 2019, 2:35 PM
 * Purpose:  1. Employee and ProductionWorker Classes
Design a class named Employee
 The class should keep the following information in 
 * • Employee name 
 * • Employee number 
 * • Hire date 
 * Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator functions for the class.
    Next, write a class named ProductionWorker
    that is derived from the Employee class. The ProductionWorker class should have member variables 
 *  to hold the following information: 
 *  • Shift (an integer) 
 *  • Hourly pay rate (a double ) The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night. 
 *  The shift variable will hold an integer value representing the shift that the employee works. 
 *  The day shift is shift 1, and the night shift is shift 
 *  2. Write one or more constructors and the appropriate accessor and mutator functions for the class. 
 *  Demonstrate the classes by writing a program that uses a ProductionWorker object.
